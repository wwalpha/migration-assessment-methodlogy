# Data Migration
Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another.

## Best Practices for Data Migration
**Back up the data before executing**: In case something goes wrong during the implementation, you can’t afford to lose data. Make sure there are backup resources and that they’ve been tested before you proceed.

**Stick to the strategy**: Too many data managers make a plan and then abandon it when the process goes “too” smoothly or when things get out of hand. The migration process can be complicated and even frustrating at times, so prepare for that reality and then stick to the plan.

**Test, test, test**: During the planning and design phases, and throughout implementation and maintenance, test the data migration to make sure you will eventually achieve the desired outcome.
