# Data Migration

Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another.

## Best Practices for Data Migration

**Back up the data before executing**: In case something goes wrong during the implementation, you can’t afford to lose data. Make sure there are backup resources and that they’ve been tested before you proceed.

**Stick to the strategy**: Too many data managers make a plan and then abandon it when the process goes “too” smoothly or when things get out of hand. The migration process can be complicated and even frustrating at times, so prepare for that reality and then stick to the plan.

**Test, test, test**: During the planning and design phases, and throughout implementation and maintenance, test the data migration to make sure you will eventually achieve the desired outcome.

## 6 Key Steps in a Data Migration Strategy

Each strategy will vary in the specifics, based on the organization’s needs and goals, but generally, a data migration plan should follow a common, recognizable pattern.

### [1. Explore and Assess the Source](./step1.md)

Before migrating data, you must know and understand what you’re migrating, as well as how it fits within the target system. Understand how much data is pulling over and what that data looks like.

There may be data with lots of fields, some of which won’t need to be mapped to the target system. There may also be missing data fields within a source that will need to pull from another location to fill a gap. Ask yourself what needs to migrate over, what can be left behind, and what might be missing.

### [2. Define and Design the Migration](./step2.md)

### 3. Build the Migration Solution

### 4. Conduct a Live Test

### 5. Flipping the Switch

### 6. Audit
