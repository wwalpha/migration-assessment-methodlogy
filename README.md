# Migration Assessment Methodlogy

## Data migration
Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another.

In the context of the extract/transform/load (ETL) process, any data migration will involve at least the transform and load steps. This means that extracted data needs to go through a series of functions in preparation, after which it can be loaded in to a target location.
